# 🎮 Number Guessing Game (GUI – Python)

<p align="center">
  🎯 A simple & interactive number guessing game built using Python and Tkinter
</p>

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Number Guessing Game** is a Python-based GUI application developed using **Tkinter**.  
The player selects a difficulty level and attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

After each guess, the application provides instant feedback:

- ⬆ **Too High**
- ⬇ **Too Low**

The game ends when:
- ✅ The correct number is guessed  
- ❌ All attempts are exhausted  

This project demonstrates:
- GUI programming using Tkinter  
- Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)  
- Random number generation  
- Basic user interaction handling
